<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I moved to the United States in 2016 and began my journey working with nonprofit organizations, including four meaningful years supporting a Buddhist temple. That experience shaped my values around service, discipline, and community. After that, I spent a year working in the pizza industry, where I learned teamwork, time management, and the importance of consistency in fast-paced environments.</p>

<p>Seeking new challenges, I transitioned into driving a semi-truck for a year and a half, gaining strong responsibility, independence, and problem-solving skills. Along the way, I also explored gig work such as Uber and DoorDash, which strengthened my adaptability and customer-focused mindset. These diverse experiences taught me how to navigate change, manage pressure, and stay resilient in different work environments.</p>

<p>I joined the U.S. Air Force in 2024 as a civil engineer and continue to serve today. Through this role, I discovered a strong passion for technology and continuous improvement. That passion has driven me to work hard toward a new career path as a software engineer and web developer, where I aim to combine discipline, technical curiosity, and real-world experience to build meaningful and reliable solutions.</p>
